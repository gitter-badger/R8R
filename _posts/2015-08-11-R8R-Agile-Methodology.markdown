[R8R](http://R8R.bz) and the [Salebarn.com, developer of R8R](http://Salebarn.com) are about enabling a truly dynamic, reputation-driven exchanges [of ideas, things, services] and a ecosystem of free, fair, open, coherent markets and taking the scientific methods of [market-based management](http://www.charleskochinstitute.org/about-institute/market-based-management/guiding-principles-five-dimensions/) to the next level.  

[R8R](http://R8R.bz) is a tight, antifragile LEAN technology, for professionals who appreciate the necessity of using a LEAN methodology. The objective of [R8R repository][https://github.com/MarkBruns/R8R] is NOT to be offer a full-feature technological solution for the masses.  In general, features induce multiplicatively more failure modes than the number of features added, they complicate the user interface and remove the user from their interest and features are always eventually exploited by security threats.
