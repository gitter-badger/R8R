[R8R](http://R8R.bz) and the [Salebarn.com, developer of R8R](http://Salebarn.com) are about enabling a truly dynamic, reputation-driven exchanges [of ideas, things, services] and a ecosystem of free, fair, open, coherent markets and taking the scientific methods of [market-based management](http://www.charleskochinstitute.org/about-institute/market-based-management/guiding-principles-five-dimensions/) to the next level.  

The [R8R repository](https://github.com/MarkBruns/R8R) offers a language-agnostic and DBMS-agnostic approach to building R&D database management systems. The objective of [R8R repository](https://github.com/MarkBruns/R8R) is for DevOps collaboration, NOT to provide a production system ... free and open source technology is free to experiment with and freely extensible, significant assistance with implementation is a professional service that provides income for the developer -- implementation is not cost-free.
