[“What if we take the relationships and connections in our data and reimagined our business along those relationships? What would that look like?”](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/a/graph-databases-2nd/337963/)  

[R8R](http://R8R.bz) takes this "What If" question a step further by asking "How we construct an evolving knowledge database if the connections or relational ties between entities in our data were neither especially equal or static in the world of **market-driven data management**? How can we allow users to have greater control over their search indices?"

[R8R](http://R8R.bz) and the [Salebarn.com, developer of R8R](http://Salebarn.com) are about enabling a truly dynamic, reputation-driven exchanges [of ideas, things, services] and a ecosystem of free, fair, open, coherent markets and taking the scientific methods of [market-based management](http://www.charleskochinstitute.org/about-institute/market-based-management/guiding-principles-five-dimensions/) to the next level.  

The [R8R GitHub repository](https://github.com/MarkBruns/R8R) is a reflection of our commitment to a very sparse, LEAN DevOps methodology. It includes a very simple, very minimal database management system along with various workflow scripts, data APIs and other resources that aim to make it more possible for professionals and small companies to efficiently network with compatible team members to deliver value to clients.
