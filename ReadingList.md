# Big Data Background
[Safari's Big Data tutorial](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/tutorials/big-data-ots/) and [Security and Privacy in Big Data tutorial](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/tutorials/security-privacy-ots/) ... the rate of data creation continues to increase; there is no foreseeable end in sight to that trend. It will likely always be true that most of the data in the world today was created in the last year and it will be increasingly likely that most people do not understand their exposure to security and privacy issues.  These tutorials will not make you an expert, but they were designed for executives, project managers, and IT managers who want to rapidly gain a sufficient, general understanding of Big Data so they can think strategically about making the most of these expanding data resources, while gaining an appreciation for [at least the more obvious] security and privacy traps and pitfalls.  The Safari bookshelf gives you access to a huge collection of professionally written, edited and published technical publications; Safari is more than just a bookshelf -- the folks at O'Reilly add additional value in a variety of different ways, eg [DevOps tag](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/blog/category/tech/) or larger [Tech channel](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/blog/category/tech/) on the [Safari blog](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/blog/) and [other Safari tutorials](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/tutorials/).  Really high-quality content like this saves time in your educational workflow by preselecting essential information from a variety of leading sources. Different published perspectives from different expert sources on the same topic is very useful ... *if you really want to think outside The Box, you should understand how "The Box" is thinking your data.*

# Storing Objects in a Database

In order to design databases, it is necessary think about applying more appropriate or efficient algorithms that exploit the particular attributes of data for managing or indexing data stores.  Toward that end, it is important to develop a better working understanding of things like [hash functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function), [checksums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checksum), [check digits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Check_digit), [digital fingerprinting algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerprint_%28computing%29), [randomization functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization_function), [forward error-correction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_error_correction), [network coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_network_coding), [cryptographic ciphers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cipher) and a variety of topics in [coding theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coding_theory).
