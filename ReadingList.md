If you want to do any meaningful development in an important emergent realm, such as [distributed databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_database), it is necessary to do a fair amount of reading and then to stay current on that reading and to learn by [being social](https://help.github.com/articles/be-social/) ... at some point, it is necessary for one curate his or her own content and to find one's own voice.  When one is starting out, there are some basic, fundamental concepts to get under one's belt in order to understand the terminology and to be able to understand the interactions between other more advanced developers in important forums like [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/sparql).

# Big Data Background
[Safari's Big Data tutorial](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/tutorials/big-data-ots/) and [Security and Privacy in Big Data tutorial](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/tutorials/security-privacy-ots/) ... the rate of data creation continues to increase; there is no foreseeable end in sight to that trend. It will likely always be true that most of the data in the world today was created in the last year and it will be increasingly likely that most people do not understand their exposure to security and privacy issues.  These tutorials will not make you an expert, but they were designed for executives, project managers, and IT managers who want to rapidly gain a sufficient, general understanding of Big Data so they can think strategically about making the most of these expanding data resources, while gaining an appreciation for [at least the more obvious] security and privacy traps and pitfalls.  The Safari bookshelf gives you access to a huge collection of professionally written, edited and published technical publications; Safari is more than just a bookshelf -- the folks at O'Reilly add additional value in a variety of different ways, eg [DevOps tag](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/blog/category/tech/) or larger [Tech channel](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/blog/category/tech/) on the [Safari blog](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/blog/) and [other Safari tutorials](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/tutorials/).  Really high-quality content like this saves time in your educational workflow by preselecting essential information from a variety of leading sources. Different published perspectives from different expert sources on the same topic is very useful ... *if you really want to think outside The Box, you should understand how "The Box" is thinking your data.*

## -- Responsiveness or rapid retrieval

In order to design [distributed] databases for lower latency, responsiveness or rapid retrieval [when data is needed], it is necessary think about applying more appropriate or efficient algorithms that exploit the particular attributes of data for managing or indexing data stores.  Toward that end, it is important to develop a better working understanding of things like [hash functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function), [checksums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checksum), [check digits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Check_digit), [digital fingerprinting algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerprint_%28computing%29), [randomization functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization_function), [forward error-correction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_error_correction), [network coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_network_coding), [cryptographic ciphers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cipher), [blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_chain_(database)), [distributed databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_database) and a variety of topics in [coding theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coding_theory).
